The workshop is broken into 3 parts, with the learning objectives as follows:

#### Part 1
- How to create search, visualizations, and liveboards to analyze data
- How to use the developer playground to generate javascript code to embed ThoughtSpot elements into a web app
- How to modify actions available to users and apply hidden runtime filters

#### Part 2
